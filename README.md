# HelloWorldElectron

I wanted to learn Electron, but the tutorial I was following was so out of date that most of the functionality didn't work, so I abandonded it, but still decided to publish the repo to GitHub.
<br>
Unfortunetly I realised that I forgot to include the <code>node_modules</code> and <code>out</code> folders in the gitignore file so this repo ended up above 100MB is size. GitHub didn't like that, so I had to learn how to clean the history of a big repository as a result... 
<br>
At least I learned something I guess
